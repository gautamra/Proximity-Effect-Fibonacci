	abstract = {We propose a real-space approach explaining and controlling the occurrence of edge-localized gap states between the spectral quasibands of binary tight binding chains with deterministic aperiodic long-range order. The framework is applied to the Fibonacci, Thue-Morse and Rudin-Shapiro chains, representing different structural classes. Our approach is based on an analysis of the eigenstates at weak inter-site coupling, where they are shown to generically localize on locally reflection-symmetric substructures which we call local resonators. A perturbation theoretical treatment demonstrates the local symmetries of the eigenstates. Depending on the degree of spatial complexity of the chain, the proposed local resonator picture can be used to predict the occurrence of gap-edge states even for stronger couplings. Moreover, we connect the localization behavior of a given eigenstate to its energy, thus providing a quantitative connection between the real-space structure of the chain and its eigenvalue spectrum. This allows for a deeper understanding, based on local symmetries, of how the energy spectra of binary chains are formed. The insights gained allow for a systematic analysis of aperiodic binary chains and offers a pathway to control structurally induced edge states.},

	abstract = {Quasiperiodic systems are aperiodic but deterministic, so their critical behavior differs from that of clean systems as well as disordered ones. Quasiperiodic criticality was previously understood only in the special limit where the couplings follow discrete quasiperiodic sequences. Here we consider generic quasiperiodic modulations; we find, remarkably, that for a wide class of spin chains, generic quasiperiodic modulations flow to discrete sequences under a real-space renormalization group transformation. These discrete sequences are therefore fixed points of a {\textbackslash}emph\{functional\} renormalization group. This observation allows for an asymptotically exact treatment of the critical points. We use this approach to analyze the quasiperiodic Heisenberg, Ising, and Potts spin chains, as well as a phenomenological model for the quasiperiodic many-body localization transition.},

	abstract = {We consider quasiperiodic tight-binding models and the effects of disorder on wavefunctions in one dimension. While in an infinite system all states are localized by disorder, however weak, in finite chains the situation is more interesting. It was shown recently for the Fibonacci nearest neighbor hopping model that certain states can be delocalized for weak disorder: Their inverse participation ratios (IPRs) decreases with disorder strength at weak disorder, goes through a minimum, and thereafter increases for stronger values of disorder. Finite size scaling analysis shows the existence of different classes of wavefunctions and non-monotonic (re-entrant) behavior. The scaling variable depends on a new critical exponent $\nu$ whose value is determined by the parameters of the quasiperiodic Hamiltonian. We show that this re-entrant dependence of the IPRs exists for the general class of Fibonacci models and provide the explanation for the different behaviors observed in terms of the type of spatial characteristics of the wavefunctions.},

Starting from an explicit tight-binding Hamiltonian with diagonal disorder and using Landauer{\textquoteright}s formula, we relate the resistance to the trace of a random unimodular matrix product whose eigenvalues are extensively studied. Special care is devoted to length scales smaller than the localisation length, where a classical ohmic behaviour is usually assumed, characterised by a resistivity proportional to the inverse localisation length. We show numerically that this scaling behaviour is masked by giant fluctuations. We explain, in a simple and pedagogical case, how the actual bepaviour of the resistance differs from the scaling prediction by resonanceeffects. Nevertheless,by summing the fluctuating eigenvalues which are studied in this work for increasing values of the length of the disordered specimen, we give a more convincing test of the validity of the finite-size concept in one-dimensional Anderson models.},

The KPM results show an excellent agreement with perturbative result in large system size limit, confirming the validity of Thouless formula. Thus, contrary to the previous numerical results, the KPM approximation of the Thouless expression produce the correct localization length at the band center. The Thouless expression relates localization length in terms of density of states in a one-dimensional disordered system. By calculating the KPM estimates of density of states, we find a cusp-like behavior around the band center in the perturbative regime. This cusp-like singularity can not be obtained by an approximate analytical calculations with in the second-order approximations, reflects the band-center anomaly.},

	abstract = {In most superconductors, the transition to the superconducting state is driven by the binding of electrons into Cooper pairs1. The condensation of these pairs into a single, phase-coherent, quantum state takes place at the same time as their formation at the transition temperature, Tc. A different scenario occurs in some disordered, amorphous, superconductors: instead of a pairing-driven transition, incoherent Cooper pairs first preform above Tc, causing the opening of a pseudogap, and then, at Tc, condense into the phase-coherent superconducting state2{\textendash}11. Such a two-step scenario implies the existence of a new energy scale, $\Delta$c, driving the collective superconducting transition of the preformed pairs2{\textendash}6. Here we unveil this energy scale by means of Andreev spectroscopy5,12 in superconducting thin films of amorphous indium oxide. We observe two Andreev conductance peaks at {\textpm}$\Delta$c that develop only below Tc and for highly disordered films on the verge of the transition to insulator. Our findings demonstrate that amorphous superconducting films provide prototypical disordered quantum systems to explore the collective superfluid transition of preformed Cooper pairs.},

	abstract = {The most profound effect of disorder on electronic systems is the localization of the electrons transforming an otherwise metallic system into an insulator. If the metal is also a superconductor then, at low temperatures, disorder can induce a pronounced transition from a superconducting into an insulating state. An outstanding question is whether the route to insulating behaviour proceeds through the direct localization of Cooper pairs or, alternatively, by a two-step process in which the Cooper pairing is first destroyed followed by the standard localization of single electrons. Here we address this question by studying the local superconducting gap of a highly disordered amorphous superconductor by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Our measurements reveal that, in the vicinity of the superconductor{\textendash}insulator transition, the coherence peaks in the one-particle density of states disappear whereas the superconducting gap remains intact, indicating the presence of localized Cooper pairs. Our results provide the first direct evidence that the superconductor{\textendash}insulator transition in some homogeneously disordered materials is driven by Cooper-pair localization.},

	abstract = {We analyse the transport properties in approximants of quasicrystals $\alpha$-AlMnSi, 1/1-AlCuFe and for the complex metallic phase $\lambda$-AlMn. These phases present strong analogies in their local atomic structures and are related to existing quasicrystalline phases. Experimentally, they present unusual transport properties with low conductivities and a mix of metallic-like and insulating-like characteristics. We compute the band structure and the quantum diffusion in the perfect structure without disorder and introduce simple approximations that allow us to treat the effect of disorder. Our results demonstrate that the standard Bloch{\textendash}Boltzmann theory is not applicable to these intermetallic phases. Indeed their dispersion relations are flat, indicating small band velocities, and corrections to quantum diffusion, which are not taken into account in the semi-classical Bloch{\textendash}Boltzmann scheme, become dominant. We call this regime the small velocity regime. A simple relaxation time approximation to treat the effect of disorder allows us to reproduce the main experimental facts on conductivity qualitatively and even quantitatively.

We consider structures of the SFS and SFSFSFS type, with thin nanometer scale F and S layers, within the ballistic regime. The spin-splitting effects of the ferromagnet and the mutual coupling between the S regions, yield several nontrivial stable and metastable pair amplitude configurations, and we find that the details of the spatial behavior of the pair amplitude govern the calculated electronic spectra. These are reflected in discernible signatures of the LDOS. The roles that the magnetic exchange energy, interface scattering strength, and the Fermi wavevector mismatch each have on the LDOS for the different allowed junction configurations, are systematically investigated.},

Our procedures allow us to study systems with long superconducting coherence lengths. We obtain results for the pair potential, the pair amplitude, and the local density of states. We use these results to extract the relevant proximity lengths. We find that the superconducting correlations in the ferromagnet exhibit a damped oscillatory behavior that is reflected in both the pair amplitude and the local density of states. The characteristic length scale of these oscillations is approximately inversely proportional to the exchange field, and is independent of the superconducting coherence length in the range studied. We find the superconducting coherence length to be nearly independent of the ferromagnetic polarization.},
